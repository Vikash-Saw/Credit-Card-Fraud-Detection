# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


Certainly! A Credit Card Fraud Detection project involves creating a system that identifies potentially fraudulent transactions made using credit cards. Here are the key steps involved:

Data Collection: Gather historical transaction data, including features like transaction amount, location, time, and cardholder information.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
Normalize or scale features to ensure consistent comparisons.
Feature Engineering:
Create relevant features (e.g., transaction frequency, average transaction amount, etc.).
Consider using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality.
Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, neural networks).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Train the selected model(s) on the training data.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Use a confusion matrix to understand true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
