# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


## Project description - A Credit Card Fraud Detection, It involves creating a system that identifies potentially fraudulent transactions made using credit cards.

### Key Concepts:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical transaction data, including features like transaction amount, location, time, and cardholder information.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates and Normalize or scale features to ensure consistent comparisons.
3. Feature Engineering: Create relevant features (e.g., transaction frequency, average transaction amount, etc.) and Consider using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality.
4. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, neural networks) and Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data and Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and Use a confusion matrix to understand true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
